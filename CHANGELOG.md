# Changelog

Player-facing changes to the LCT 40k TTS table.

How this file is used by the compiler (`compile.py --release`):
- The **topmost** `## vX.Y.Z` heading is the current version. It is stamped into
  the TTS save name (e.g. `LCT - v1.0.0`) and into the
  in-game `GAME_VERSION`.
- The `-` bullet points directly under that heading are the patch notes shown
  to players in-game the first time they open a map built from a newer version
  than their saved game.

To cut a release: add a new `## vX.Y.Z` section at the top with its bullets,
then run `python3 compile.py --release`.

## v1.13.0
- Feat: Added a REWIND BATTLE button next to REGISTER ARMY. Opens a panel to pick any recorded round/turn/phase and restore models, VP, CP and secondaries to that moment, or jump back to the moment before the panel was opened.

## v1.12.0
- Feat: Added REGISTER ARMY buttons (right-click to clear) next to HIDE/SHOW ARMY, registering your models so the game can track them through the battle. Lays the groundwork for the upcoming Battle Rewind feature.

## v1.11.3
- UI Scoreboard change for better visibility and new button underneath scoring overlay.

## v1.11.2

- Fixed some minor map mistakes with ruins placement.

- Changed Lightning settings from background to Gradient. 
- Refreshed Battlemaster maps.  

## v1.10.2
- Reverted vortex to it's previous state where it would destroy objects instead of store them, also now the lid closes again on click! 
- Removed Select all dice button from roll dice
-- New Highlight button on the dice tray (next to Coherency/Engagement): select models and press it to paint them in the colour shown on the swatch next to it - click the swatch to cycle colours. The paint sticks until you RIGHT-CLICK Highlight, which clears all highlights from the table. Coherency Check and Engagement Range were renamed to Coherency and Engagement to make room.
- Added Tacoma Open FAQ since it's written by GW Rules team 
- 2nd performance pass 
- Changed a bit some icons in the overlay

## v1.10.0
- Added the first pack of LCT maps, 15 are now in (1 for each matchup) that aim to be both thematic and close to GW terrains that they showed us. Also they will have a lot of texture randomization. The next packs will come soon!
- Improved clock in the overlay. There is a Pass/Pause button in the overlay. Also I 've added shortcuts (that work now) that allow each player to Pass the clock and Pause/Resume the active clock. Also now the clock (if active) will pass to the other player when passing the turn.
- Updated the cards from Shinobau, also reduced drastically their image size. This is the first optimization pass that I am working on.
- Additional overlay fixes, now it should be in a less intrusive/annoying position. It will still "reset" due to how TTS works so keep that in mind.


## v1.9.3 
- Fixed bug where End of Battle scoring didn't count towards 45 pts primary limit. 
- Some UI cleanups and buttons changing positions.
- Refreshed Battlemaster maps
- Added an endless 6-dice bag next to each players tray just in case something bugs out. 
- Chess clock rework: new "Pass Chess Clock" and "Pause Chess Clock" game keys (bind them under Options -> Game Keys). Anyone can use them - passing stops the running clock and starts the opponent's, and works even while paused. The old numpad 7/8/9 keys now do the same instead of the confusing per-seat behaviour. 
- Added play/pause buttons next to each clock in the score overlay. Play starts that clock; pause stops the running clock and, pressed again, resumes whoever was on the clock. 
- Fixed the chess clock ignoring the next click after a spectator pressed it. 
- The chess clock now follows the turn: passing the turn while the clock is running automatically switches it to the new active player (a paused or not-yet-started clock is left alone). 

## v1.9.2 
- Added set mission button that sets mission to the board state. This is more of a QoL for people who play non-comp modes. 
- Additional default tokens for basic things to the left of each players board 
- Back-end clean up for better map management.
